#Bar chart template

This is the bar chart template used by The Gazette and KCRG for many of our simple online charts.
[Example chart](http://thegazette.com/subject/news/education/school-district/cedar-rapids-schools/cedar-rapids-school-district-being-investigated-over-race-based-discipline-20140905)

To use, create a new folder in the projects directory and copy over the CSS, JS, JSON directories and the index.html file. In the JS/script.js file is a list of variables you'll use for the chart. JSON data is used for the charts. All styles are within the CSS folder.

See examples in the projects folder.
